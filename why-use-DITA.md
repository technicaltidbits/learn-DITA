# Why use DITA?

## Content becomes more readable

Content becomes much more readable in topic-based authoring, as topics contain the information needed to perform a particular task, like creating a new Vue project, or the information needed to understand the basics of component-based JavaScript.

Because each topic serves a particular purpose—to explain how to do a task, provide background information, or provide a detailed list of facts about tools and products—the material is easier for a user to scan and find the information they need. 

## Reduces information overload 

Topics help to reduce information overload.  Users often need small amounts of information at a time. Too much content or too much detail may alienate your readers.  Topics force readers to limit the scope of the topic.

For example, if a writer is writing instructions on how to create a new Vue project, they should not delve into component-based JavaScript frameworks or explain what Babel is. The instructions should be clear and task-oriented. This means that writers can produce content that is easy to scan, focused on one piece of information, and supports user goals.

## Improves collaboration process

Topic-based authoring greatly improves the writing and collaboration process between technical writers, subject matter experts (SMEs), quality assurance engineers, and technical editors. SMEs and quality assurance engineers can quickly review topics as they're completed rather than waiting for a longer document. Feedback, too, becomes more focused.  This speeds up the review process and ultimately decreases the amount of time needed to produce deliverables.

## Shortens revision process

A new software release means updating the documentation. If you find that new information is needed, or information needs to be restructured, you can easily rearrange topics. Writers can easily create a new topic and insert that topic where needed rather than scrolling through a long document.
