# Topic structure

You must declare the DITA topic at the top of the XML document. Most XML editors do this for you. The declaration consists of two lines of code:

```xml
<?xml version= "1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE task PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DITA task//EN" "task.dtd">
```

The first line of this code is called the **XML declaration**. It identifies the document as being an XML document.

The second line of code is called the **XML Document Type Declaration**. In this example, the document type is **task**. 

The code that follows depends on the topic you're writing.
