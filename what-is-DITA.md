# What's DITA?

The Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) is a modular framework for creating and maintaining content. DITA is focused on and built upon **topic-based authoring**. 

## Topic-Based Authoring

The premise of topic-based authoring is that each unit of information is a _topic_. At minimum, a topic has a title and content. Topics should be able to stand on their own and function as independent topics rather than be condensed into long, textbook-style material. 

The traditional textbook-style way of writing content often involves mixing up instructions with explanations. For example, a document that teaches you how to create a new Vue project may also have sporadic explanations about the history of Vue. The topic loses its focus.

Topics should answer one of these questions:

* What is...?
* How do I...?
* What do I do if...?
